# As you may know, an anagram is a new word created by reorganizing all the letters in a word.
# This list of anagrams are all based on the word "Stop"
anagrams = ["plots", "post", "stop", "puts", "tops"]

# Run this program after you try each step and see if it worked.
# At the very bottom of this file is a line of code that prints out the list after your code is run.
# You're welcome to print additional debugging statements if you need.

# 1. Print out the third word in the list using bracket notation.

print(anagrams[2])



# 2. The word "opts" is also an anagram of the word "stop". Find a way to add "opts" to the end of the list.

anagrams.append("opts")
print(anagrams[5])



# 3. The word "puts", on the other hand, is not an anagram of the word "stop". Find a way to replace it with the word "pots".

anagrams[3] = "pots"
print(anagrams[3])



# 4. Use the documentation to figure out what the method ".pop()" does.
#   Now use it to remove the word "plots" (which isn't a correct anagram of "stop") from our list.

anagrams.pop(0) 
print(anagrams[0])



# 5. Put the final list of anagrams in alphabetical order, and SAVE it.
# (If you encounter an error here, it's probably because Python is sorting it temporarily, but then immediately restoring it to the original order.)


anagrams.sort()



# This code prints the list after you've manipulated it above.
# print(anagrams)

# LEVEL 2: At this point, the tasks will get more challenging, because you'll work with datasets too large to handle by just looking at it and reading it.
# The lists used in the second half of this lab will be stored in a neighboring file called "other_lists.py".
# If you'd like to look at that file, you certainly may, but do your work here.
# This line of code connects the data.
import other_lists

# Pro-tip: to make this easier, comment out the line "print(anagrams)" above so that you aren't printing extra information.
#
# 6. The first list is called "fortunes" and contains fortune-cookie style fortunes. Print out a random fortune from the list.
#     Remember to access the list with "other_lists.fortunes" because is is in a different file.

import random     # You're going to need a method from the random library.

print (random.choice(other_lists.fortunes))


# 7. This list is huge, so it'd be helpful to know how many fortunes are listed. Find a way to print out the number of fortunes in the list.


print(len(other_lists.fortunes))


# 8. Challenge: Out of all the fotunes that are there, it'd mess up the program if some were listed twice, but with a list that big, it could happen.
# Find a way to check and see whether any of the fortunes are duplicates. If so, find a way to delete those duplicates.

def has_duplicates(listObj):
    return len(listObj) != len(set(listObj))

for fortune in other_lists.fortunes:
    if has_duplicates(fortune):
        other_lists.fortunes.pop( )
